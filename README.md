# Client-Resume-Benedicta
A professional digital resume built with semantic HTML5 and custom CSS for a Nutrition &amp; Virtual Assistant client.
❗ The Problem
The client needed a structured, modern resume that stands out to recruiters and demonstrates technical competence.

✅ The Solution
I built a semantic HTML5 skeleton and styled it with custom CSS. Key features include:

Centered Hero Section: A balanced layout for a strong first impression.

Circular Image Masking: Using border-radius to modernize the profile portrait.

Semantic Structure: Ensuring the site is accessible and well-organized for search engines.
